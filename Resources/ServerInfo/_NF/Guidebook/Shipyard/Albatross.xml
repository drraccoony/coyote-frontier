  "A very large, heavy-duty cargo-hauling shuttle designed by the USSP-based Kesha Aerospace Plant, featuring modular pod storage and a robust salvage bay for supplanting freight work with small-scale mining operations. Expensive, but its very high-density cargo stowage makes it worth it for those with the money to invest."

  "End-user modifiable!"
    
  # PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST
  
  ## 1. Power supply
  
  ## 1.1. Battery units
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SubstationBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="APCBasic"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check that the substation unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check that the SMES units are anchored to the floor.
  - Check that the shuttle's APC units have their breakers toggled On.
  
  ## 1.2. S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PortableGeneratorSuperPacmanShuttle"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="FuelUranium"/>
  </Box>

  - Check that the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generators units are anchored to the floor.
  - Check that the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generators units has fuel. For extended flights make sure that you have enough fuel stockpiled to sustain prolonged power generation during flight.
  - Check that the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generators units are set to HV output.
  - Set the Target Power on both units for 35 [bold]kW[/bold]. This will ensure there is no power deficit; the running power draw with thrusters enabled is 67.3kw.
  - Start the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generators units.
  
  ## 2. Atmospherics
  
  ## 2.1. Distribution Loop
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OxygenCanister"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="NitrogenCanister"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPort"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasMixer"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check that the oxygen and nitrogen canisters are anchored to their respective connector ports.
  - Check that the mixer unit is set to 101kPa.
  - Check that the gas mixer is set to the correct mixing ratio (22% Oxygen, 78% Nitrogen).
  - Enable the mixer unit.
  
  ## 2.2. Waste Loop

  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirAlarm"/>
  </Box>

  - Ensure that the waste loop pipes are all properly installed.
  - Ensure the waste loop pump is powered and enabled. It is located under the catwalk next to the power storage units.
  
  ## 3. Other checks
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Gyroscope"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GravityGeneratorMini"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check that the gyroscope is anchored, powered, and enabled.
  - Check that the mini gravity generator is anchored, powered, and enabled.
