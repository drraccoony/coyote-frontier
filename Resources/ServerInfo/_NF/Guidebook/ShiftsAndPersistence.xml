  # Shifts and Persistence

## Shift Duration

Shifts in the Coyote Sector typically last around [color=#33bbff]3 days[/color] of real time.
This extended duration allows for deep space exploration, complex trading operations, and long-haul cargo runs.

You can check how long the current shift has been running by looking at your [color=#44cc00]PDA[/color].
The shift duration is displayed in the format [color=#33bbff]D:HH:MM:SS[/color] (Days:Hours:Minutes:Seconds).

For example:
- [color=#ffcc00]0:02:30:45[/color] means 0 days, 2 hours, 30 minutes, and 45 seconds
- [color=#ffcc00]2:14:05:12[/color] means 2 days, 14 hours, 5 minutes, and 12 seconds

If an admin has set a shift end time, you'll also see [color=#ff6666]"Time Left In Shift:"[/color] displayed beneath the shift duration.

## What Persists Between Shifts?

### Persistent (Saves)
- [color=#44cc00]Bank Account Balance[/color] - Any money deposited at an ATM on Nash Station
- [color=#44cc00]Character Preferences[/color] - Your character's appearance, name, and loadout choices
- [color=#44cc00]Job Preferences[/color] - Your selected job priorities

### Non-Persistent (Does Not Save)
- [color=#ff6666]Ships and Shuttles[/color] - All vessels are removed at round end
- [color=#ff6666]Items and Equipment[/color] - Everything you're carrying or storing
- [color=#ff6666]Station Modifications[/color] - Any construction or changes to stations
- [color=#ff6666]Physical Possessions[/color] - Cargo, materials, weapons, tools, etc.
- [color=#ff6666]Ship Deeds[/color] - Ownership documents reset each shift

## Important Tips

[color=#ffaa00]Make sure to deposit your earnings![/color]
Before ending your shift or logging out, visit a [color=#44cc00]Galactic Bank ATM[/color] on Nash Station to deposit any cash you've earned.
Money not deposited will be lost when the shift ends or if you leave your character.

[color=#ffaa00]Sell your ship before shift ends![/color]
Since ships don't persist between shifts, consider selling your ship back at the [color=#cccc00]Shipyard Console[/color] before the shift ends to recover some of your investment.

[color=#ffaa00]Plan for long sessions![/color]
With shifts lasting around 3 days, you may log out and rejoin multiple times during a single shift.
Your character will remain in the world when you disconnect, so find a safe place to rest (like cryo chambers) if you need to take a break.
