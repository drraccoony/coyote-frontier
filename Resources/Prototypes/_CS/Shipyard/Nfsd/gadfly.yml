# Shuttle Notes:
# the alchemist is neat but very stinky and very limited. that, and the role of 'response ship with bells and whistles' is still nonexistent, whereas the DETECTIVES get their full sized medium ships... so this is an entry into that class of NFSD ship.
# for comparisons sake, the alchemist is sort of like a hospitaller with a chem lab sidecar, this is more of a broadhead for brigmedics. it's an NFSD alternative to civilian ships of this function and form
